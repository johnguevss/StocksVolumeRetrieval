Task1

task1.ipynb is my answer for task 1. 
Required packages are stored in requirements.txt.
TSLA_average_vol_per_year.csv is a sample output.

Your fictional, technically inept coworker, named Drew, is inexplicably obsessed with with
Tesla stock and asks you complete the following task:
Alpha Vantage provides a number of APIs for retrieving stock market and cryptocurrency
information: https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/.
You will need to sign up and provide an email address for the API services. If you do not
wish to use your personal email address you may consider using a temporary email service
such as https://temp-mail.org/en/.
Use the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve weekly stock data for ‘Tesla’ for the last 5 years.
Using this data, output the average volume per year to a CSV file.
The output should have the following columns:
● STOCK
● YEAR
● AVERAGE_VOLUME
NOTE: you will need to generate an API key - instructions are on the site (link above). The site also
shows examples on how to request and unpack data from their API.

Task2

Answer is written in task2.txt.

Your coworker, Drew, is ecstatic about your work in Task 1. Now that he’s had a taste of
automation, he wants more: he wants a CSV to be produced every day that contains
yesterday’s closing price of 25 stocks. Due to restrictions, you must implement the solution
using either the AWS Lambda service or the Amazon ECS service.
Select a service (either AWS Lambda or Amazon ECS) to implement the task, and verbally
defend your decision. Focus on the comparison of these services rather than the
orchestration (triggering the service daily). Submit as a .txt file.
NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS TASK! We are interested in your ability
to research a topic and draw conclusions.

Task 3

Answer is written in task3.

Your least favorite coworker, Drew, resigned and took a job at a small retail company. Thank
goodness, you were losing patience with his requests. Not so fast! Alas, he reaches out to
you with one final request:
W3Schools provides a sandbox SQL database containing sample retail data:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_asc.
Explore the database and think of a business question that can be answered by querying
the data. If you’re able to, write the SQL query to answer the question.
Submit a .sql file which explains the business question in a comment, and the SQL query to
answer the question.
Since this task is quite open-ended, here’s an example business question: which
employees have fulfilled the fewest orders? Providing support to these employees could
increase efficiency.
Note: this is a great opportunity to show off your creativity and analytical thinking! However,
if you’re struggling to think of a business question, feel free to write a query to answer the
example business question.
