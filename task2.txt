I would use AWS Lambda to implement Drew's application for several reasons. First, the application is small and can finish running in seconds, a few minutes max. 
Because of this, it can comfortably run within Lambda's timeout limit of 15 minutes. If it runs greater than 15 minutes, Lambda will be automatically out of the choices. 
Second, since Lambda is billed for how long your program ran upto the millisecond and the program can finish fast, Drew can save money, 
ECS can run on top of EC2 billed by spot instance, but it is not guaranteed to run daily on demand, since it only uses spare computing capacity. 
Third, I want Drew to focus on his stock trading rather than managing and securing his EC2 instance used by ECS, which is possible with Lambda since it is serverless 
and everything is already managed by AWS. He can use Fargate, another serverless service, with ECS, but it would incur additional costs.
